### Tech Stack

Kar-Utils uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [JSP] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [IntelliJ] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Spring boot] - evented I/O for the backend
* [jQuery] - lightweight JavaScript Library.

And of course Kar-Utils itself is open source with a [public repository][Karthikeyan]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Kar-utils requires [Java](https://www.java.com/) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the Application.

```sh
$ cd Kar-utils
